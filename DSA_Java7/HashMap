clear()	Removes all of the mappings from this map.
clone()	Returns a shallow copy of this HashMap instance: the keys and values themselves are not cloned.
compute(K key, BiFunction<? super K,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction)	Attempts to compute a mapping for the specified key and its current mapped value (or null if there is no current mapping).
computeIfAbsent(K key, Function<?super K,? extends V> mappingFunction)	If the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped to null), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping function and enters it into this map unless null. 
computeIfPresent(K key, BiFunction<? super K,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction)	If the value for the specified key is present and non-null, attempts to compute a new mapping given the key and its current mapped value. 
containsKey(Object key)	Returns true if this map contains a mapping for the specified key.
containsValue(Object value)	Returns true if this map maps one or more keys to the specified value.
entrySet()	Returns a Set view of the mappings contained in this map.
get(Object key)	Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key.
isEmpty()	Returns true if this map contains no key-value mappings.
keySet()	Returns a Set view of the keys contained in this map.
merge(K key, V value, BiFunction<? super V,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction)	If the specified key is not already associated with a value or is associated with null, associate it with the given non-null value.
put(K key, V value)	Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map.
putAll(Map<? extends K,? extends V> m)	Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this map.
remove(Object key)	Removes the mapping for the specified key from this map if present.
size()	Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map.
values()	Returns a Collection view of the values contained in this map.
